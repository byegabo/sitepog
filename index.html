<h1>About fish</h1>
<p>Spinning Fish refers to a 3D GIF of a fish spinning around to various songs, such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfMegACVJQw" target="_blank">"Freaks"</a> by Surf Curse and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6dqIYKIBSU" target="_blank">"Funkytown"</a> by Lipps Inc. The GIF has been used in numerous ironic meme videos on YouTube.</p>

<h2>Origin</h2>
<p>While it is unclear where the 3D fish GIF comes from, on September 25th, 2020, YouTube user MrFatCatMan uploaded the earliest low-resolution video featuring the spinning fish, adding it to the song "Bumpy Ride, Nightcore Version" by Mohombi. The video received more than 230,000 views in three years (shown below).</p>
